                In my Master's thesis at KTH, I trained language models to
                improve a Swedish open-source speech-to-text model for a
                specific domain. The domain-specific language models are not
                open-sourced but I trained a generic language model which is
                currently the highest ranking speech-to-text model on the
                Swedish Common Voice test set.
                <br />
                <br />
                The generic model can be accessed through Hugging Face directly
                or by using the TMH Python package where it is integrated. A
                link to the full thesis report will be included shortly.

                studies, I continued working part-time. It's a small company
                where I had the opportunity to work in all parts of the stack
                and on several different projects.

                camera of a laptop and hand tracking with MediaPipe, we trained
                a classifier for sign language. Using this classifier, we built
                a program for teaching sign language.
